# Overview
Self supervised model was developed using SimCLR architecture to train a backbone on unlabelled data and further train on labeled dataset.
Google colab notebooks and Kaggle notebooks were used to run the code.
## SimCLR Method

## Utilization of Google Cloud Services
Models,trained weights and backbones were saved in Google Cloud Bucket using Google Cloud API.Then supervised models can be trained after loading those backbones.
