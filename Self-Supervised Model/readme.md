# Overview
Self supervised model was developed using SimCLR architecture to train a backbone on unlabelled data and further train on labeled dataset.
Google colab notebooks and Kaggle notebooks were used to run the code.

Models,trained weights and backbones were saved in Google Cloud Bucket using Google Cloud API.Then supervised models can be trained after loading those backbones.
